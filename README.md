# ComputerVision_Python_OpenCV_FingerProgram
A program where the user shows his/her fingers and decides which option should be activated.


In this code we run the Main_Program.py and then with our hand we do the following :
 1)If we show on the camera 1 finger the program runs the Gesture Metric module that counts the distance between the thumb and the index finger.
 
 2)If we show on the camera 2 fingers the program detects the eyes of the user and if the user stops showing his/her eyes then the program stops and goes back to the show fingers camera.
 
 3)If we show on the camera 3 fingers the program detects the user's face.
 
 4)If we show on the camera 4 fingers the program runs the speech recognition module and returns to the previous screen (show fingers camera) when we say the word "stop".
 
 5)If we show on the camera 5 fingers the program estimates the users pose.


Have fun!
